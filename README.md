# PageGPT
A Safari web extension that can answer your questions on any web page. 

Final project of Stanford CS224U Natural Language Understanding

The project is a Safari web extension. The extension functions as an intelligent chatbot capable of providing users with real-time answers to their queries about the current web page they are viewing.

In the application, a sophisticated retrieval system is built based on the Stanford Colbert model to perform dynamic indexing of the web page's content and user questions, ensuring the most up-to-date information retrieval. Then, a template-based question-answering mechanism is implemented which uses the retrieved context to generate highly relevant responses based on the content of the web page.
